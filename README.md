# 1.3. Java Collections (Level 1 - Exercise 1)

## Project Description üìÑ

This Java project solves the following exercise:

"Create a class called Month with a "name" attribute (which will store the name of the month of the year). Add 11 Month objects (each with a different attribute) to an ArrayList, except for the object with the "August" attribute. Then, it performs the insertion in the place that corresponds to that month and shows that the ArrayList maintains the correct order.

Convert the ArrayList from the previous exercise into a HashSet and make sure it doesn't allow duplicates.

Iterate through the list with a for and an iterator".

This exercise demonstrates the use of ArrayList, HashSet, and iteration in Java. 

The goal is to create a Month class, add 11 Month objects to an ArrayList (excluding August), insert August in its correct position, and then convert the ArrayList to a HashSet to ensure no duplicates are allowed. Finally, the program iterates through the collections using a for loop and an Iterator.
